**Message From Mars**

Message From Mars is a web application that utilizes NASA's MARS rover images and passes them through the Microsoft Computer Visions API, which generates an array of tags describing the image. These tags are then passed through a third API, Bing image search, which renders an image based on the tags. The two images are displayed side by side creating a computer generated diptych of an image from Mars and corresponding image from Earth. The process of generating the results is a conversation between three machines, leaving the viewer with a triptych representation of their findings. 
The app features two models, one for users, who are able to sign in and save images. Another model for guest users, who are able to search but not save their searches.
